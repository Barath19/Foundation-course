A lower number of dimensions in data means less training time and less computational resources and increases the overall performance of machine learning algorithms
Dimensionality reduction avoids the problem of overfitting
Dimensionality reduction is extremely useful for data visualization
Dimensionality reduction removes noise in the data
Dimensionality reduction can be used for image compression
